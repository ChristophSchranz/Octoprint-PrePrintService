# OctoPrint-PrePrintService

This plugin supports your 3D printing workflow by featuring an **auto-rotation** and **slicing** service.
As both tasks are very computation-intensive, they can optionally be outsourced to 
external docker containers.

## Workflow

The full workflow can be deployed either on a single machine or the octoprint server connected
to a printer plus a server.

![Workflow](/extras/workflow.png)

The following steps will be done:

1. Slice a model using the PrePrint server Plugin.
2. The model will be auto-rotated for a proper 3D print.
3. The auto-rotated model will be sent back to the octoprint server.
4. The optimized model will be sliced using [slic3r](https://slic3r.org/).
5. The final machine code wil be sent back to the octoprint server.
6. The printing can be started.

Each step is optional and can be set in the settings.

## Requirements

1. One server node that is connected to your 3D printer, like a raspberry pi.
1. One server node for pre-processing, which has at least 2GHz CPU frequency. If the node connected
   to the printer is strong enough, one server suffices.
1. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/community-edition#/download) version **1.10.0+**
   on the more powerful node.
2. Install [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) version **1.6.0+**
   on the more powerful node.
3. Optional: Install [Docker Swarm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x843GyFRIIY)


## Setup

### 1. Install the Plugin

Install the PrePrint Server plugin via the bundled [Plugin Manager](http://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html)
or manually using this URL on the Printer-Controller

    pip install "https://github.com/christophschranz/OctoPrint-PrePrintService/archive/master.zip"
    
If you read the label `Using PrePrint Service` in the navigation bar of the octoprint server, 
the installation was successful.

### 2. Install the PrePrint Service

In order to make the service highly available, the PrePrint Service should be deployed
 in docker. If you are
not familiar with docker yet, have a quick look at the links in the 
[requirements-section](#requirements) and install it on the performant node.

Then run the application locally with:

    git clone https://github.com/christophschranz/OctoPrint-PrePrintService
    cd OctoPrint-PrePrintService
    docker-compose up --build -d
    docker-compose logs -f
     
Optional: The `docker-compose.yml` is also configured to run in a given docker swarm,
 adapt the `docker-compose.yml` to your setup and run:

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose push
    docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml preprintservice


The service is available [localhost:2304/tweak](http://localhost:2304/tweak) 
(from the hosting node), 
where a simple UI is provided for testing the PrePrint Service.
Use `docker-compose down` to stop the service. (If you ever wish ;)

## Configuration

Configure the plugin in the settings and make sure the url for the PrePrint service is 
correct:

![settings](/extras/settings2.png)

To test the whole setup, do the following steps:

1. Visit [localhost:2304/tweak](http://localhost:2304/tweak), select a stl model file
   and make an extended Tweak (auto-rotation) `without` slicing. The output should be
   an auto-rotated (binary) STL model. If not, check the logs of the docker-service
   using `docker-compose logs -f` in the folder where the `docker-compose.yml` is located.

2. Now, do the same `with` slicing, the resulting file should be a gcode file of the model.
   Else, check the logs of the docker-service using `docker-compose logs -f` in the 
   same folder.

3. Visit the octoprint server and try to slice an uploaded stl model file. After
   some seconds a `.gco` file should be uploaded. Note that in a small time frame a
   `.gco` file with only one line and 83 bytes can appear. This is expected and should be overwritten
   afterwards after a short time.
   If this doesn't work, start the octoprint server per CLI with `octoprint serve`
   and track the logs. The following two lines are expected:
   
        2019-04-07 22:28:44,301 - octoprint.plugins.preprintservice - INFO - Connection to PrePrintService on http://192.168.48.81:2304/tweak is ready, status code 200
        2019-04-07 22:28:44,321 - octoprint.plugins.preprintservice - INFO - Connection to Octoprint server on http://192.168.48.43:5000/api/version?apikey=A943AB47727A461F9CEF9EXXXXXXXX is ready, status code 200

   If the the Octoprint Server's URL is invalid, you will see this:
   
        2019-04-07 22:27:34,746 - octoprint.plugins.preprintservice - WARNING - "Connection to Octoprint server on http://192.168.48.43:5000 couldn't be established"

   If you see instead the following, please check the APIKEY: (403 - forbidden)
        
        2019-04-07 22:30:09,570 - octoprint.plugins.preprintservice - WARNING - Connection to Octoprint server on http://192.168.48.43:5000/api/version couldn't be established, status code 403

   If the the PrePrint Server can't be reached, you will see this:
   
        2019-04-07 22:27:34,746 - octoprint.plugins.preprintservice - WARNING - Connection to PrePrint Server on http://192.168.48.81:2304/asdf couldn't be established

   Make also sure that your selected `profile` file is correct.
